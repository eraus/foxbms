Below is a roadmap related to the BMS

  * foxBMS is the one forked from foxBMS.org. The files are here as the function of our own code development. 
  * The new development's repo is phxBMS (pronounced as Phoenix BMS). This will be the ropo for the current Phoenix project.
  * There will be a future repo named soxBMS (simple open and flexible BMS). 
  This soxBMS will be used to host the foxBMS primary code only. 
  Also, there may be a chance to use the STM32446E-EVAL board as a replaceent of the foxBMS master board.
